    title: "Welcome to DevLeo",
    description: "DevLeo is a personal initiative dedicated to sharing projects, ideas, and research in a clear, expressive, and didactic way. While its structure resembles that of a digital magazine, its purpose goes beyond simple publication, serving as a space for continuous documentation, reflection, and experimentation. The platform brings together software development projects, technical studies, and research-oriented work, presenting not only final results but also the processes, challenges, and decisions involved in each initiative. By combining practical development with analytical and investigative approaches, DevLeo seeks to bridge the gap between implementation and understanding. Through articles, project showcases, and technical notes, the site aims to promote knowledge sharing, encourage critical thinking, and provide a transparent view of ongoing learning and exploration across different areas of technology and science.",
